# The `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` option in SSH prevents SSH from asking for confirmation when connecting to a new host for the first time.  

# ### **Why is this needed?**  
# By default, when you connect to a new server via SSH, it asks:  
# ```
# The authenticity of host 'X.X.X.X (X.X.X.X)' can't be established.
# ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:xxxxxxx.
# Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
# ```
# This happens because SSH stores the known host fingerprints in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. If the host is new or its fingerprint has changed, SSH warns you about it.  

# ### **How `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` helps**  
# Setting `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` **automatically accepts the host key** and prevents SSH from prompting the user for confirmation. This is useful in automation scripts where human input is not possible.

# ### **Potential Risks**
# - It **disables host authenticity checks**, making it easier for a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** to succeed.
# - If a malicious server with the same IP replaces your instance, SSH will not warn you.

# ### **Safer Alternatives**
# Instead of disabling host key checking, you can use:
# 1. **Add the host key automatically to known_hosts**:  
#    ```sh
#    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -i my-key.pem user@server
#    ```
#    - This will **only accept new hosts**, but warn if an existing fingerprint changes.
#    - Available in OpenSSH 7.6+.

# 2. **Manually specify a known hosts file** (avoids modifying the global known_hosts file):  
#    ```sh
#    ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i my-key.pem user@server
#    ```
#    - This means SSH will never store the host fingerprint.

# ### **Best Practice for Terraform and Automation**
# - In temporary automation scripts, `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` is fine.
# - For production environments, use `accept-new` or manually manage `known_hosts`.
